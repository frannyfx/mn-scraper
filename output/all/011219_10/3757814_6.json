I'm new on here as looking for some advice/reassurance. My little boy is just over 2. He has always been a great eater and in a good routine. Recently, he has stopped eating chicken and meat. He loved chicken pesto and any beef dish. Now, he won't touch it. I'm not sure if it's the texture as he will eat it if it is hidden in foods. He's trying so hard to feed himself and get frustrated when we try to help him. Has anyone experienced their child going off meats at the this age? We're trying not to make a fuss and just keep trying. Thanks"},{"id":"92001796","author":"fuzzymoon","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 18:17:01","text":"Hi. Let him make a right mess. Give him a spoon but allow him to use his fingers. \n\nDon't clean him whilst he eats and don't say things like 'oh your face is all mucky' or use language or expressions that mean dirty or oh no. \nClean him up at the end saying yay you did well. \n\nThe reason being is that if you use any language , tone or gesture that is negative his subconscious memory will learn food is dirty and they become fussy eaters."},{"id":"92002549","author":"GD22","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 18:47:21","text":"Thanks fuzzy moon.

It’s very normal and very annoying. \n\nI’d just keep offering it, but don’t comment if it’s not eaten. Praise if it is. Sometimes the phase lasts a week or 2. Sometimes years. Honestly it’s very frustrating, but I think all toddlers do it"},{"id":"92011068","author":"Caterina99","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 01:43:57","text":" And yes like fuzzy moon said - just cut it up small and let him eat it himself. With fingers or fork. Don’t comment on it. At this stage you just want him to eat it and the time for making a fuss about table manners is later"},{"id":"92012632","author":"GD22","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 07:49:32","text":"Thank you very much Caterina99. We'll just keep trying. I think it is an independence thing!"}]}
