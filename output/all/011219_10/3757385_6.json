The last few weeks has been in discomfort at night - struggling to bring wind up and seems worse when placed on his back - will sleep when on his tummy on our chest. \nWe’ve tried infacol and gripe water with varying degrees of effectiveness but nothing that’s improved it for him greatly. \nHV suggested Colief. \nWe used for first time last night and he seems in more discomfort than ever ☹️ Very unsettled and clearly in line or discomfort. \nHas anyone else experienced this with colief? \nCan I use gripe water too??"},{"id":"91989012","author":"mommymooo","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 08:14:54","text":"I used colif on my boy and worked well after a few days you have to use it exactly as it says and I used it with hipp comfort milk and kept him upright for about 20 minutes after a feed and he turned in a different baby it really worked. Also if you have a understanding helpful doctor they will prescribe it for you.

If not could you look at a different type of milk? \n\nCould you try a sling, sorry if that sounds stupid, but is he o.k in the day upright? It might be worth looking to see if it is safe to raise the cot head end?\n\n[flowers] It does get better. My DD was allergic to milk, and I didnt realise for so so long due to mixed feeding."},{"id":"91989389","author":"36Ames","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 08:35:26","text":"Thank you. \nHe is combi-fed but 90% is BF. \nWill persevere and see if we get improvements. In the day he’s not bad as he’s predominantly upright. Seems to just be nighttime when he’s on his back and mainly from 1am onwards x"},{"id":"91992917","author":"Justanother123","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 11:04:34","text":" We had this with our 10 week old DD. Turned out it was silent reflux. We’ve taken her to a cranial osteopath twice and she’s a different baby. Still wakes up in the night for feeding but none of the straining and obvious discomfort that was keeping all of us awake! She’s also happier in the day as she is sleeping well at night.

In my experience infacol, gripe water, colief etc. is pointless if your baby is really in pain. It just doesn’t do enough. \n\nAt 8 weeks old it’s completely normal for babies to not want to be put down, which makes things difficult to get them (and you!) to sleep safely. \n\nWe tried everything but in the end giving up dairy solved the issue. She’s 16 months old now and still can’t have it now.\n\nMay be worth a trip to the GP as they may prescribe gaviscon for reflux or ranitidine if that doesn’t work."}]}
