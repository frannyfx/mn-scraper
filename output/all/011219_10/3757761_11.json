Did your children get tummy bugs yearly? My DD got 3 stomach bugs between the age of 13 months and 2. Then she had no more until she started nursery. She had 2 stomach bugs last winter at nursery. I'm just wondering if now she's at school it may start to improve. I know people don't have a crystal ball but it would be nice to dodge it this year."},{"id":"92000500","author":"smemorata","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 17:24:04","text":" Funny you should ask as my dd is almost ten and had one this weekend - first time in 8 years. In fact she got freaked out as she couldn't remember vomiting before."},{"id":"92000525","author":"Bogoffrain","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 17:25:34","text":" My nine year old has never been sick in his life."},{"id":"92000537","author":"Mrscog","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 17:26:01","text":" Mine definitely calmed down after the first few - although DS2 seemed to pick up a few at 4 when the rotavirus vaccination wore off."},{"id":"92000557","author":"PaquitaVariation","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 17:26:59","text":" Depends on the child I think. Stomach bugs are my ddâ€™s Achilles heel, she gets one approximately every other year, despite good handwashing etc, but also has vomiting episodes if she has a temperature. Ds however has only had two in 15 years."},{"id":"92000677","author":"Bogoffrain","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 17:31:29","text":" Iâ€™m sure it depends on the child, my DS twin has a bug once and was sick ON him But he didnâ€™t catch it! Touch wood I donâ€™t get them either"},{"id":"92019121","author":"Madaboutthem2","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 13:30:59","text":" Ooo not many get it every year. I'll keep my fingers crossed!"},{"id":"92019130","author":"Madaboutthem2","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 13:31:25","text":" @smemorata poor thing. Hope she's better soon. Xx"},{"id":"92019189","author":"bakingcupcakes","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 13:34:35","text":" DS (5) gets them yearly. The last 2 years have been mid December so I'm expecting one shortly. Before he was born I hadn't had one for over 10 years. Since he arrived I've had more than him."},{"id":"92019699","author":"Madaboutthem2","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 13:57:20","text":" @bakingcupcakes that's how it's been for me. I never got them maybe twice! I hope it improves this winter for you too. I hope it doesn't show up this side of Christmas now ðŸ˜©"},{"id":"92019772","author":"mindutopia","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 14:00:49","text":" My 6 year old has only ever had one tummy bug (probably around 3 ish). Generally, most illnesses are less frequent once they start school assuming they've been in nursery before as they have built up immunity to most things by then. It also very much depends on where you live, quieter rural areas don't quite get the same volume of bugs passing through as schools in urban areas where there is a lot more coming and going and exposure to all sorts of things."}]}
