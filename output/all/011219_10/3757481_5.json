She's generally being pretty good about it, apart from being a bit more teary but I think that's to be expected initially as she's basically having her good vision taken away from her. The patch is on 3 hours a day.\n\nMy concern is the adhesive seems really sticky and it seems to really hurt her when it comes off. Her face remains red for a couple of hours afterwards. It didn't seem that bad the first day when the opthalmologist did it, so I wander if it's a technique thing? I am concerned that her face is going to get more and more sore, and getting her to wear it will become more of a battle. \n\nThe patches say they are allergen free and designed for sensitive skin. Has anyone got any tips to make it hurt her face less?"},{"id":"92001577","author":"Nix2020","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 18:07:33","text":" Have your tried a hot wash cloth over it to loosen the sticky part?"},{"id":"92004142","author":"SuperStingray","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 19:43:58","text":" I tried with cool water today which did help a bit, so I'll try with some warmer tomorrow."},{"id":"92004228","author":"bookgirl1982","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 19:46:10","text":"Fabric patches which hook into glasses are much easier for little ones. \n\nMy son has ones from meyepatch and happily wears them. He always had a total meltdown over the sticky ones. Having a few and allowing a choice of pattern helped in the early days."},{"id":"92004295","author":"Lollypalooza","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 19:48:16","text":" Does she wear glasses?
