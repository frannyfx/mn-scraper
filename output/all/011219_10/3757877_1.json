Rarely cried, always smiling ect. But for the past few weeks she’s been almost constantly whinging! \n\nShe cries when I leave the room, cries when I pick her up, cries when I put her down, cries when I try and feed her, cries when I take the food away, cries when I have the audacity to take something dangerous off of her... [grin]\n\nShe’s been sitting up since 4 months, crawling since 5, and has just started to stand unaided. Her sleeping has also gotten worse, although it’s still not too bad (she used to sleep 7-7 but for the past couple of weeks won’t fall asleep until 8/9pm and will wake up at 5/6am, so still not terrible). She still has her sunny moments but they’re punctuated by periods of extreme grumpiness! I admit that in recent weeks I’ve found it quite hard and not always enjoyed being a mum [grin]\n\nShe is better when we’re out and about in the pram so I try and get out with her every day. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I want my sunny baby back! [grin]"}]}
