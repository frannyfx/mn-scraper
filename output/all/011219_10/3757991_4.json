Will be spending Xmas with my extended family including my sister's family. Her son is 3 and my son nearly 5. The boys love each other but get so excited together and it irritates the rest of the family! They are well behaved on their own but have a tendency to want to play with the same toy and fight and make lots of noise.\nLooking for inspiration for some calm Xmas games and activities we can do so they don't get too tired. Quite simple so 3 year old can manage them.\nIdeas so far include making mince pies and the game with half an Xmas card hidden and they have to find the other half. Thanks"},{"id":"92007600","author":"milliefiori","date":"Sun 01-Dec-19 21:43:33","text":"If you've got a willing adult how about a game of them both wrapping up an adult in used wrapping paper? (sort of like the toilet roll mummy game which children love.)\n\nTake them out for a scavenger hunt walk to spot Christmassy things from a list: a robin, a wreath, a reindeer ornament (or real one) etc"},{"id":"92011864","author":"Ricekrispie22","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 06:41:40","text":"I’ve seen Christmas-themed skittles in Laura Ashley. \nMake a matching pairs memory game with a Christmas theme"},{"id":"92011918","author":"Isitme13","date":"Mon 02-Dec-19 06:46:58","text":"There’s a good Christmas lotto game in Tesco (I think). I already have it from previous years, and it goes down well with my dc. \n\nHow about printing out some Christmas colouring sheets? \n\nOr take along foam clay in relevant colours and a shoe box and build a winter/Christmas scene, adding to it each day (bonus being that it can be left with granny/suitable relative once finished!)"}]}
